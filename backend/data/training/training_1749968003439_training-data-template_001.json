  "input": "Do I need GST registration if my turnover is ₹30 lakh in Karnataka?",
  "output": "In Karnataka, for FY 2025-26, GST registration is mandatory if your annual turnover exceeds ₹40 lakh for services or ₹20 lakh for goods. Since your turnover is ₹30 lakh, registration is not mandatory unless you supply goods or engage in inter-state supplies. Voluntary registration allows you to claim input tax credit (ITC) and attract B2B clients. Do you supply goods, services, or both?",
