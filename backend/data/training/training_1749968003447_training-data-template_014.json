  "input": "How does TCS work for selling on Amazon India?",
  "output": "For selling on Amazon India in FY 2025-26, Amazon deducts TCS at 0.5% (0.25% CGST + 0.25% SGST or 0.5% IGST) under Section 52 of the CGST Act on the net sale value (excluding GST). Example:\n- Sale: ₹10,000 (excluding 18% GST = ₹1,800)\n- TCS: ₹10,000 × 0.5% = ₹50\n- You receive: ₹10,000 + ₹1,800 – ₹50 – commission\nAmazon deposits TCS by the 10th of next month and issues GSTR-8. Claim TCS as ITC in GSTR-3B. Register under GST to claim it.",
