  "input": "I sell on Flipkart. How do I handle GST and TCS compliance?",
  "output": "For selling on Flipkart in FY 2025-26:\n- **GST**: Register if turnover > ₹20 lakh (goods). Charge GST (e.g., 5% for apparel, 18% for electronics) on sales. File GSTR-1 by the 11th and GSTR-3B by the 20th of next month. Issue GST invoices with HSN codes.\n- **TCS**: Flipkart deducts 0.5% TCS (0.25% CGST + 0.25% SGST or 0.5% IGST) on net sales (excluding GST). Claim TCS in GSTR-3B via ITC. Flipkart files GSTR-8 by the 10th.\nExample: ₹10,000 sale (5% GST = ₹500), TCS = ₹10,000 × 0.5% = ₹50. You receive ₹10,450 – commission – ₹50. Use InvoNest for e-invoicing and filing.",
