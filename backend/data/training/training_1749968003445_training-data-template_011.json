  "input": "I’m a freelancer with ₹10 lakh turnover. What taxes do I pay?",
  "output": "As a freelancer with ₹10 lakh turnover in FY 2025-26:\n- **GST**: Mandatory registration if inter-state supplies or turnover > ₹40 lakh (services). Charge 18% IGST/CGST+SGST, file GSTR-3B monthly/quarterly. Claim ITC on business expenses.\n- **Income Tax**: Under new regime, tax on ₹10 lakh (after ₹75,000 standard deduction) is ~₹45,000 (including cess). Old regime may save more with deductions (e.g., 80C, 80D). File ITR-3 by September 15, 2025.\n- **TDS**: Clients deduct 10% TDS (Section 194J) if payments > ₹30,000/year. Reconcile with Form 26AS.\nUse InvoNest for GST-compliant invoicing. Are you registered under GST?",
