  "output": "With ₹10 lakh turnover, GST registration isn’t mandatory unless you supply inter-state services or sell goods (> ₹20 lakh). Benefits of voluntary registration:\n- Claim ITC on expenses (e.g., software, internet).\n- Attract B2B clients who prefer GST-registered vendors.\n- Avoid reverse charge for inter-state clients.\nDownside: Monthly/quarterly compliance. Register via gst.gov.in using TAN if no PAN. InvoNest simplifies GST filing. Do you have inter-state clients?",
