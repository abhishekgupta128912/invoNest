# InvoNest Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in InvoNest to protect against current and future cyber threats. Our security framework follows industry best practices and addresses the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Security Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation Security (Implemented)

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: OTP-based 2FA for enhanced security
- **Brute Force Protection**: Rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds (minimum 12)
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure API key system with permissions and rate limiting

#### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Comprehensive Input Sanitization**: Protection against XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks
- **File Upload Security**: MIME type validation, size limits, and malicious file detection
- **Request Size Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks through large payloads
- **Pattern Detection**: Real-time detection of malicious patterns in user input

#### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- **Multi-tier Rate Limiting**: Different limits for authentication, API, and general endpoints
- **Progressive Delays**: Slow down suspicious requests without blocking legitimate users
- **IP-based Tracking**: Monitor and limit requests per IP address
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Adjust limits based on user behavior and threat level

#### 4. Security Headers & Network Protection
- **Enhanced Helmet Configuration**: Comprehensive security headers including CSP, HSTS, and more
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS attacks through content restrictions
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security**: Enforce HTTPS connections

### Phase 2: Advanced Protection (Implemented)

#### 1. Security Monitoring & Logging
- **Real-time Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events
- **Threat Detection**: Automated detection of suspicious activities and attack patterns
- **Security Event Classification**: Categorized logging with severity levels
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance and forensic analysis

#### 2. Data Protection
- **Encryption Services**: Built-in encryption utilities for sensitive data
- **Secure Key Management**: Proper handling and storage of encryption keys
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic sanitization of sensitive data in logs
- **Secure File Handling**: Protected file upload and storage mechanisms

#### 3. Vulnerability Management
- **Automated Security Audits**: Regular security assessments and vulnerability scanning
- **Security Scoring**: Quantitative security posture assessment
- **Vulnerability Tracking**: Systematic tracking and remediation of security issues
- **Security Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations for security improvements

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-minimum-32-chars
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100

# Production Security Settings
NODE_ENV=production
HTTPS_ENABLED=true
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Security Middleware Stack

1. **Security Headers**: Applied first to set security headers
2. **Request Logging**: Log all requests for monitoring
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Real-time threat detection
4. **Input Sanitization**: Clean and validate all input
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Authentication**: Verify user identity
7. **Authorization**: Check user permissions

## API Security

### Authentication Methods

1. **JWT Tokens**: For user authentication
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
   ```

2. **API Keys**: For programmatic access
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer sk_<api-key>
   ```

### Rate Limits

- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Authentication**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **OTP Requests**: 3 requests per minute
- **Public API**: 60 requests per minute

### Security Headers

All API responses include security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Security Monitoring

### Security Dashboard

Access the security dashboard at `/api/security/dashboard` (admin only) to view:
- Overall security score
- Recent security events
- Vulnerability reports
- Security recommendations
- System health status

### Security Events

The system monitors and logs the following security events:
- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Brute force attacks
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Rate limit violations
- API key misuse
- Injection attack attempts
- File upload violations

### Alerting

Security alerts are triggered for:
- Critical vulnerabilities
- Repeated attack attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- System security degradation

## Incident Response

### Automated Response

The system automatically responds to threats by:
- Blocking suspicious IP addresses
- Throttling suspicious requests
- Logging security events
- Alerting administrators

### Manual Response Procedures

1. **Identify**: Use security dashboard to identify threats
2. **Contain**: Block malicious IPs and disable compromised accounts
3. **Investigate**: Review security logs and audit trails
4. **Remediate**: Apply security patches and updates
5. **Monitor**: Continuous monitoring for recurring threats

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication**: Use provided authentication middleware
3. **Authorization**: Check user permissions for all operations
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events appropriately

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Audits**: Run security audits regularly
2. **Monitor Logs**: Review security logs daily
3. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and secure
5. **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management best practices
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls

### Audit Requirements

- Security audit logs retained for 90 days
- Critical security events retained for 1 year
- Regular vulnerability assessments
